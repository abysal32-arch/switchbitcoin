//! `SwapApp` — the top-level run-loop that composes the four orchestration
//! drivers into ONE re-enterable "run a swap" entry point for an app/frontend.
//!
//! Increments 1–4 built the seams as SEPARATE drivers — the pre-funding
//! [`FundingDriver`], the settlement-spine [`SwapDriver`] (over the
//! [`SwapEngine`] Phase-A/Phase-B primitives), the congestion
//! [`BackstopDriver`], and the crash-re-entry [`RecoveryDriver`] — but nothing
//! wired them end-to-end. `SwapApp` is that wiring: a single caller-facing type
//! that carries one swap from a match through funding and settlement to a
//! persisted terminal, with the backstop and the whole-wallet crash recovery
//! exposed through the same surface.
//!
//! # The two halves of the API
//! * **One live swap** — [`SwapApp::begin`] → [`poll`](SwapApp::poll)* →
//!   terminal. `poll` sequences the FundingDriver poll loop and, on
//!   `Proceed`, crosses the [`into_funded`](FundingDriver::into_funded) handoff
//!   into the engine's settlement spine ([`enter_settlement`](SwapEngine::enter_settlement)
//!   → [`step_settlement`](SwapEngine::step_settlement)) — all behind one
//!   [`AppTick`]. [`backstop_tick`](SwapApp::backstop_tick) is the
//!   primary-INDEPENDENT congestion/dead-device concern, run on its own cadence.
//! * **Whole wallet** — [`SwapApp::recover`] re-enters every crashed swap from
//!   the persisted store (delegating to [`RecoveryDriver::reenter_all`]). A live
//!   `SwapApp`'s in-flight `Possessing`/transport do NOT survive a crash by
//!   design — the durable truth is the engine's `SwapRecord`, and recovery
//!   re-derives the deadline-driven continuation from the record alone.
//!
//! # Engine boundary + forward-or-refund (unchanged from the drivers it composes)
//! The app DECIDES; the caller BROADCASTS. [`AppTick::BroadcastSetup`] and
//! [`AppTick::Completed`] hand signed bytes / a signature to the caller for the
//! wire. The only terminals are [`AppTick::Completed`] (both legs go through),
//! [`AppTick::Refunding`] (the pre-armed refund is the automatic exit, our
//! escrow was locked), and [`AppTick::Aborted`] (nothing was ever locked); every
//! "cannot proceed yet" is a re-drive ([`Wait`](AppTick::Wait) /
//! [`AwaitingReveal`](AppTick::AwaitingReveal) /
//! [`AwaitingVerification`](AppTick::AwaitingVerification)).
//!
//! # Frozen-surface note
//! Pure composition of the built wallet ranks over the existing
//! `Transport`/`ChainView` traits — no curve math, no new settlement-core
//! surface.
//!
//! # Crash story: the early `Funding` record
//! [`SwapApp::setup_broadcast`] persists a PROVISIONAL-ROLE `Funding` record the
//! moment the caller confirms our Setup is on the wire — the instant the
//! crash-exposure window of a funded escrow opens. From then on the swap is
//! durable: a crash anywhere before the `Proceed` handoff is re-entered by
//! [`SwapApp::recover`] (the record surfaces the standing pre-armed refund),
//! `SwapEngine::open`'s lease reconcile keeps the funding coin leased (no
//! phantom re-expose of a coin the in-flight Setup spends), and a funded
//! pre-funding abort advances the record to `AbortRefund` so recovery drives
//! the completion-supersedes refund decision. The role is corrected to the
//! derived one at the `Proceed` handoff (the store permits this only while the
//! record is still `Funding` — see `SwapStore::check_against`). The remaining
//! unrecorded stretch is only the caller-side gap between its actual broadcast
//! and its `setup_broadcast` call; a re-driven restart heals it (the fresh
//! driver re-issues `BroadcastSetup`, the re-broadcast is idempotent, and
//! `setup_broadcast` re-runs), and even inside that gap a pre-funding ABORT
//! cannot mislabel: `terminate_abort` also consults the chain's authoritative
//! funding reading, classifies funded, and writes the record it found missing.
//!
//! Known residual (LOW, documented — not fund-loss): a funded-classified abort
//! whose Setup later falls out of every mempool and NEVER confirms leaves its
//! `AbortRefund` record permanently non-terminal (the refund spends an escrow
//! outpoint that never came to exist, so it can never confirm) and the
//! pre-encumbrance coin `Leased` to a swap that will never settle. The coin is
//! untouched ON-CHAIN (recoverable by rescan); retiring such a record needs
//! either the signed Setup bytes persisted for rebroadcast (a store schema
//! bump) or a provable-nonexistence recovery arm — tracked in RESUME.md.
